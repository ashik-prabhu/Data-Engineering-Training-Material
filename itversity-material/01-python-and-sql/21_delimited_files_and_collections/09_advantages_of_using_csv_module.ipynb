    "## Advantages of using CSV Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us go through the advantages related to CSV.\n",
    "* Readability and lesser code while dealing with files containing delimited records or lines.\n",
    "* We can avoid iterable of strings as intermediate data structure while reading delimited data from files as well as writing the iterables of tuples or dicts into delimited files.\n",
    "* Data processing libraries such as **pandas**, **pyspark**, etc have lot more options while dealing with delimited files as well as iterables using tuples or dicts. But the additional capabilities comes with additional overhead.\n",
    "* We typically use **csv** over **pandas** or **pyspark** as part of backend development for web or mobile applications. Libraries such as **pandas** and **pyspark** are more relevant for data driven applications which involves heavy weight data processing."
