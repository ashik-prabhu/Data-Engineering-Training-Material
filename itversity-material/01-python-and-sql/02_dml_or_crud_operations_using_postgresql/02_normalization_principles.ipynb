    "Most of the well designed Data Models will be in either 3rd Normal Form. BCNF is used in some extreme cases where 3rd Normal Form does not eliminate all insertion, updation and deletion anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reporting Environments\n",
    "While normalization is extensively used for transactional systems, they are not ideal for reporting or descision support systems. We tend to use dimensional modeling for reporting systems where tables will contain pre processed data as per the report requirements."
