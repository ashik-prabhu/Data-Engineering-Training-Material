    "Let us try to get daily product revenue using retail tables.\n",
    "* daily is derived from orders.order_date.\n",
    "* product has to be derived from products.product_name.\n",
    "* revenue has to be derived from order_items.order_item_subtotal.\n",
    "* We need to join all the 3 tables, then group by order_date, product_id as well as product_name to get revenue using order_item_subtotal.\n",
    "* Get Daily Product Revenue using products, orders and order_items data set.\n",
    "* We have following fields in **orders**.\n",
    "  * order_id\n",
    "  * order_date\n",
    "  * order_customer_id\n",
    "  * order_status\n",

    "  * product_image\n",
    "* We have one to many relationship between orders and order_items.\n",
    "* **orders.order_id** is **primary key** and **order_items.order_item_order_id** is foreign key to **orders.order_id**.\n",
    "* We have one to many relationship between products and order_items.\n",
    "* **products.product_id** is **primary key** and **order_items.order_item_product_id** is foreign key to **products.product_id**\n",
    "* By the end of this module we will explore all standard transformations and get daily product revenue using following fields.\n",
    "  * **orders.order_date**\n",
    "  * **order_items.order_item_product_id**\n",
    "  * **products.product_name**\n",
    "  * **order_items.order_item_subtotal** (aggregated using date and product_id).\n",
    "* We will consider only **COMPLETE** or **CLOSED** orders.\n",
    "* As there can be more than one product names with different ids, we have to include product_id as part of the key using which we will group the data."
