    "* Now I would like to perform this task to understand about **relative path**. You can access files using relative paths.\n",
    "  * Open Terminal\n",
    "  * Run `cd /data/retail_db`. You are using absolute path of `retail_db` here to change to that directory.\n",
    "  * Run `ls -ltr`. You should see the files and folders. The entries which start with `d` are folders or directories.\n",
    "  * Now run `cd orders`. You are using relative path of orders to get into the folder `/data/retail_db/orders`. As `orders` is the subfolder or subdirectory under `/data/retail_db`, you will be able to get into it with out any issues.\n",
    "  * We can also represent the directory which we are in using `.` and parent directory using `..`.\n",
    "  * If you look at the output of `ls -ltr` which was run earlier, you can see other folders as well along with `orders`. `order_items` is one of them.\n",
    "  * Now you are in `/data/retail_db/orders` and `/data/retail_db` also have `order_items`. You need to run `cd ../order_items` to get into the `order_items` folder using relative path.\n",
    "  * You can also use absolute path from any where any time. For example from any folder you can run `cd /data/retail_db/products` to get into products folder.\n",
