    "Let us get an overview of File IO. Files are typically saved in hard drive and we need to perform file i/o to read the data from the files into memory as objects. Here are the commom operations related to files.\n",
    "* Read the data from the files into objects (typically collections).\n",
    "* Write the data in the collections into files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the common file formats we use for both reading as well as writing.\n",
    "* Text Files\n",
    "* Parquet\n",
    "* Binary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the common specific file format we use with in text files.\n",
    "* Files with delimited or separated values. The most common delimiter or separator is comma. However, we might even use other delimiters such as pipe, cap (shift + 6), Ascii null, Ascii tab character etc.\n",
    "* JSON Files - we will get into the details about JSON files at a later point in time.\n",
